### Notice
Starting October 12th, 2023 GitHub is enforcing mandatory [two-factor authentication](https://github.blog/2023-03-09-raising-the-bar-for-software-security-github-2fa-begins-march-13/) on my account.  
I'm not going to comply and move all my activity to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitendo/) instead.  

Thanks and see you there!
